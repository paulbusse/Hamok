# Todo list

- use unavailability, for all sensors
  - requires birth and will messages
    - requires birth message
    - requires will message
- more secure usage of MQTT
- validate that all monitors in the list exist
- delete monitors in HA that are no longer configured, by deleting the corresponding topics
- upgrade to Python 3.9 and 3.10.
- detect if hamok runs in virtual env
- reload config on signal (systemctl?) or use an MQTT topic
- Validate return codes in callback on connect
- Validate return codes in callback on publish
- Validate return codes in callback on subscribe
- set device class for HA devices
- on re_connect publish all the available values
- reverse engineer state bitmap
- config file through environment variable
- add option for debug mode. Rename the devel logger, debug
- give names to threads and use them in logging
- extract version information from the system
- Make the max number of failures configurable
- What if MQTT is not available
- set the urllib timeout

# Refactoring

- use f-strings everywhere
- all jobs should be created using schedule
- entity.factory: oekofen specific part should go to oekofen.py
- move the configurations from const.py to config.py

# Low priority

- allow extended clientids

# Under discussion

## Needs a valid use case

- use attributes for the sensors
- send updates on regular basis (after a given period) instead of only when it changes


## create all entities disabled

HA allows entities to be disabled. We could create all entities, Ã–kofen provides, disabled and the user could enable them in HA

- PRO: we do not need to maintain the `monitor` list in the configuration file
- CONTRA: we will be sending a lot of useless information

Solution: make this configurable?

# Declined Todo's

'No' is an eligible answer. In this section we explain why we won't implement certain things.

## disconnect from the terminal

In production we use systemd. This means that the process is not connected to any terminal. If we run it from a terminal we want to see logs on the terminal, so disconnectin is not a useful feature.

Note that when we run from a terminal, we should make sure the output is directed to the terminal. That requirement remains.
